# Furniture placement model that takes room and furniture point clouds and predicts placement position and orientation

## Architecture
The model architecture was adapted from my understanding of the paper from MIT Spark Lab (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066) and is a diffusion based model.

## Dataset
Dataset used was actually a Robotics dataset (ProcTHOR-10K) and doesn't really have ideal ground truths for furniture placement
